# GeoMuse - Connect. Collaborate. Create.

GeoMuse is a social mobile app **in concept phase** designed to connect musicians and stimulate collaboration. Imagine being able to find other musicians in your area, play together, form bands and share your musical journey with the world.

* **Newsfeed:** Share updates, photos, videos and your latest tracks.
* **Filters by Genre:** Find musicians who share your musical tastes.
